A robotics project which is able to play tic-tec-toe in real world. Mainly it is C language base project, but we also use openCV to implement. OpenCV library is used to create an OCR which is used to detect and fetch input 'X' &amp; 'O'. Then the process is made where the input is given and considers the output.
